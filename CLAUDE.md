## System Components

### Minimal Backend Architecture (Production-Ready)
1. **Core API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/auth/login` - JWT authentication with bcrypt password verification
   - `/api/auth/me` - User profile and role information
   - `/api/protocols` - CRUD operations with advanced search, filtering, and status management
   - `/api/protocols/{id}/status` - Protocol status transition workflow
   - `/api/protocols/{id}/versions` - Version management and history tracking
   - `/api/protocols/{id}/documents` - Document upload and management with version linking
   - `/api/documents/{id}` - Document download and deletion with security controls
   - `/api/protocols/search-facets` - Dynamic filter options for advanced search
   - `/api/document-types` - Available document classification types
   - `/health` - System health monitoring

2. **Database Schema**:
   - **Users**: Authentication, roles (Admin, Researcher, Committee Member), profile data
   - **Protocols**: Complete protocol lifecycle with enum-based status tracking and versioning
   - **ProtocolVersions**: Complete version history with change tracking and audit trails
   - **Documents**: File attachment management with metadata, versioning, and security controls
   - **Enums**: ProtocolStatus, ReviewPriority, ContainmentLevel, VersionChangeType, DocumentType, DocumentStatus for data integrity

3. **Architecture Features**:
   - Async SQLAlchemy 2.0 with PostgreSQL asyncpg driver
   - JWT token-based authentication with refresh tokens
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) system
   - Clean separation of concerns with modular router structure

### Full-Stack Integration (✅ COMPLETED)
1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Frontend login form → Backend JWT verification → Protected routes
   - Automatic token refresh and session management
   - Role-based dashboard routing and permissions

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - Real protocols stored in PostgreSQL database
   - User accounts with encrypted password storage
   - Protocol status tracking with audit trails

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (Vite dev server)
   - Backend: http://localhost:8005 (FastAPI with Uvicorn)
   - Database: PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
   - Proxy configuration for seamless API communication
