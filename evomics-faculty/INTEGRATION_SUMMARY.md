# Evomics Ecosystem Integration Summary

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Shared Design System ✅
Created a unified design system in `evomics-shared/` directory:
- **colors.css**: CSS custom properties for consistent color palette
- **typography.css**: Font scales and text classes
- **animations.css**: Transitions, hover effects, and loading states
- **tailwind.base.js**: Base Tailwind configuration for all sites
- **STYLE_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive documentation

### Phase 2: evomics-students Updates ✅
- Integrated shared design system
- Updated navigation to charcoal theme (gray-800)
- Applied white card styling with subtle shadows

- Added cross-site navigation links

### Phase 3: evomics-workshops Updates ✅
- Integrated shared design system
- Converted multi-page navigation to charcoal theme
- Removed all emojis from interface
- Updated UnifiedNavigation component
- Applied consistent accent colors

## Design Consistency Achieved
